# KAUST Visualization Vignettes Miniapp - gray-scott

This is a 3D 7-point stencil code to simulate the following [Gray-Scott
reaction diffusion model](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.261.5118.189):

```
u_t = Du * (u_xx + u_yy + u_zz) - u * v^2 + F * (1 - u)  + noise * randn(-1,1)
v_t = Dv * (v_xx + v_yy + v_zz) + u * v^2 - (F + k) * v
```

A reaction-diffusion system is a system in which a dynamical system is attached to a diffusion equation, and it creates various patterns. This is an equation that simulates the chemical reaction between the chemicals $U$ and $V$. $U$ is called the activator and $V$ is called the repressor.

## How to build
Make sure `MPI`, and `VTK` are installed. These are non-optional dependencies. You can also enable `Catalyst` and or `Ascent` for more visualization options.

### Catalyst ###
The easiest way to get catalyst and VTK is to use the ParaView Superbuild. This will also enable easy live viewing from Catalyst in ParaView.

```
Catalyst needs to be built with the SAME MPI compiler as gray-scott

git clone --recursive https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview-superbuild.git
cd paraview-superbuild
git checkout v5.13.3
cd ..
mkdir paraview-build
cd paraview-build
ccmake -DUSE_SYSTEM_mpi=ON -DUSE_SYSTEM_python3=ON -DENABLE_catalyst=ON -DENABLE_mpi=ON -DENABLE_netcdf=ON -DENABLE_hdf5=ON -DENABLE_python3=ON -DENABLE_openmp=ON  ../paraview-superbuild
make -j
```

### Ascent ###
To build ascent, follow one of the methods listed in the Ascent documentation. Below is the method that we have tested. 

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/alpine-dav/ascent.git
cd ascent
env prefix=build env enable_mpi=ON enable_openmp=ON  ./scripts/build_ascent/build_ascent.sh
export Ascent_DIR=/home/kressjm/packages/ascent/build/install/ascent-checkout/lib/cmake/ascent
```



### Building Gray-Scott ###
```
cd <path_to_gray-scott>
mkdir build
cd build
ccmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install \
  -DENABLE_TIMERS=ON \
  -Dcatalyst_DIR=<path_to>/paraview-build/install/lib/cmake/catalyst-2.0 \
  -DVTK_DIR=<path_to>/paraview-build/install/lib/cmake/paraview-5.13/vtk \
  ../.
make
make install
```

Running install will move all the interesting settings and implementation specific scripts into the install directory for easy use.


## Running with VTK ##
VTK is a mandatory dependency of this code. We use it for logging and for basic output from the simulation. Below is how to run the `pvti` writer with Gray-Scott.

mkdir run-catalyst-live
cd run-catalyst-live
export CATALYST_CLIENT=<your_viewer_IP>
```

> Run ParaView GUI, start catalyst connection
>
> If you are running with MPI, you have to manually start a `pvserver` with the number of procs that you are using for the simulation, or you will just see one block from the simulation.
>
> i.e. `mpirun -np 4 pvserver`
> Then, connect to that pvserver from paraview
> Then, start catalyst.

## Running with Ascent ##
Ascent is an optional dependency and will allow you to use the power of Ascent, trigger, VTK-m, and more, to create great visualization pipelines and renderings. Below are some examples on ways to use Ascent. 


### How to run with catalyst in situ ###
> ðŸ’¡ **Note:** You must copy the `ascent_options.yaml` and the `ascent_actions` file you are using into your run directory. Ascent looks for a file called `ascent_options.yaml` when it runs, if it is not there, it will run a default action. In addition, you can change the actions you have ascent do by changing the name of the actions script in the options file.  


```
cd <path_to_install>
mkdir run-ascent
cd run-ascent
ln -s ../ascent_options.yaml .
ln -s ../ascent-extract-png.yaml .
ln -s ../ascent-slice-iso-png.yaml .
